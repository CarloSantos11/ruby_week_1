A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. 
Also called associative arrays, they are similar to Arrays, but where 
an Array uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object 
type.

Hashes enumerate their values in the order that the corresponding keys 
were inserted.

A Hash can be easily created by 
using its implicit form:
=end
grades = { "Jane Doe" => 10, "Jim Doe" => 6 }
favorite_foods = {japanese_food: "sushi", american: "burgers", indian: "biryani"}
